## 🎬 About the App

Caffeine isn’t just an app — it’s a smooth animated experience. When launched, a coffee ghost gently floats onto the screen to welcome you. From there, it’s your turn:

- **Select your coffee type** – Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino, and more!  
- **Pick your cup size** – Small? Medium? Large? Your call.

Everything is beautifully designed to match the original Figma mockup, with smooth animations and user-friendly interactions.
